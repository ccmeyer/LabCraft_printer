## v1.2.0-rc.3 - 2026-07-06

### Added

- Added release metadata for the `v1.2.0-rc.3` release candidate.
- Integrated the camera/refuel release candidate line with release-aware online/offline updates and controlled rollback support.
- Added droplet camera capture coordination, capture diagnostics, manual refuel checking, and dual-stream detection improvements from the v1.2.0 release-candidate line.

### Changed

- Set the app `VERSION` to `v1.2.0-rc.3`.
- Advertised `v1.2.0-rc.3` as the current release candidate in `releases/latest.json` while leaving stable at `v1.1.2`.
- Recorded that this release candidate uses the bundled firmware artifact from the v1.2.0 release-candidate line.

### Validation

- Full Python suite passed before the metadata-only RC3 bump:
  `.\env\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q`
- Focused release updater validation:
  `.\env\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q tests/test_update_and_restart.py tests/test_create_update_bundle.py tests/test_app_update_request.py`

### Rollback

- Recommended rollback version: `v1.1.2`.

## v1.1.2 - 2026-07-06

### Added

- Added repo-tracked application release metadata.
- Added release manifests for `v1.1.0`, `v1.1.1`, and `v1.1.2`.
- Added a stable release index for future version-aware updater work.
- Added installed app version display in the Application Update area.
- Added release-aware online update checks using the stable release named by upstream `releases/latest.json`.
- Added release-aware online update apply behavior using `git merge --ff-only <release-tag>`.
- Added release-aware offline bundle creation with `tools/create_update_bundle.py --release <version>`.
- Added release details to offline bundle manifests and offline update checks.
- Added an explicit `Install Offline Bundle` action for selecting support-provided update manifests.
- Added release details to update confirmation and startup result messages.
- Added support-only release rollback using verified release metadata and `git reset --hard` after dirty-worktree checks.
- Added rollback-specific updater window and startup result messaging.
- Added controlled rollback UI actions for checking/restoring the configured rollback target and support-provided offline rollback bundles.

### Changed

- Online app updates now target named stable release tags instead of arbitrary upstream branch head.
- The app passes the confirmed target release to the standalone updater process.
- Offline Git bundle updates can now target named release tags while preserving compatibility with existing branch/commit manifests.
- Operators can intentionally validate and install an offline bundle without waiting for the online check to fail.
- Rollback remains constrained to release metadata or support-provided offline bundles; arbitrary tag selection is not exposed.
- No firmware, device protocol, motion, or pressure-control changes.

### Validation

- Static metadata validation.
- Focused updater-related tests:
  `.\env\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q tests/test_update_and_restart.py tests/test_create_update_bundle.py tests/test_app_update_request.py`
- Focused release-aware updater tests:
  `.\env\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q tests/test_update_and_restart.py tests/test_app_update_request.py`
- Focused release-aware offline bundle tests:
  `.\env\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q tests/test_create_update_bundle.py tests/test_update_and_restart.py tests/test_app_update_request.py`
- Focused explicit offline install tests:
  `.\env\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q tests/test_app_update_request.py tests/test_update_and_restart.py`
- Focused support rollback tests:
  `.\env\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q tests/test_update_and_restart.py tests/test_update_window.py tests/test_app_update_request.py`
